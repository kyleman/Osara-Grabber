# Using Osara Grabber

## in finder with the GUI
After downloading, Unzip the zip file. Run Osara_Grabber.command. If MacOS warns you about not being able to run it, try running it by pressing capslock + shift + control + m. Then click on open in the menu that should pop up.

## from terminal
If you cloned the repo, change directories to the Osara Grabber directory and run `./Osara_Grabber.command`

# Current limitations
* This does not install the keymap.
#Does not let you install anywhere other than the default reaper UserPlugins folder for now.
* I have personally only tested this with MacOS 10.15.4 Catalina. While it should work an other versions of MacOS, that is untested territory.
